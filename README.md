Hello, This project is related to E-commerce web testing using selenium. In this project, i will be automating a user role test case, such as product search, adding items to the cart, checkout, and verification of the order confirmation page.



Steps Involved:

Search Automation: Automate the search for desired product without a search bar. Write tests for the validation of whether the correct product has found or not.
Add to Cart: Emulate adding several items to the cart and drive automation for the verification of the content of the cart - quantities and total.
Checkout Process: Automate the process of filling out forms based on user details, payment methods, and verification with regard to successful checkout using the generation of a receipt.
This project will give me experience in the testing of dynamic elements and how to handle various scenarios regarding product availability and fluctuating prices.

Thanks for visiting!
